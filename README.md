<h1>End to End Data Science Project using the Udemy Dataset</h1>

This repository contains the data analytics insights of the Udemy courses datasets of 4 selective major domains.

This dataset is taken from the Kaggle website. 

The link is below. https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/udemy-courses 

This dataset includes 3683 courses  from Udemy in 4 areas: business finance, graphic design, musical instruments, and web design. 
Udemy is an online platform for massive open online courses (MOOCs) that has both free and paid courses. Udemy's business model is that anyone can make a course, which is how it has grown to have hundreds of thousands of courses. Online courses and digital learning are becoming more and more popular these days. And more students, teachers, and even professionals are taking classes online through sites like Udemy, Coursera, and so on. So, this data analysis is done to figure out how many people sign up for courses on the Udemy platform.

From the insights developed, I answer the following questions:
